### Reflection
Doing this was really hard. We had to design the Swing Arm by looking at the map it was really hard.I didn't know where to start or how to do it. MR. H helped me get start he explained the map to me than he designed the first part for me so I know where to start. After that I kinda knew where to start. The dimension was the hard part for me I was so confused about the dimension they were just bunch of numbers and I didn't know which dimension is for which area's. Thanks to MR. H and MR. Dierolf they helped me a lot with this project. 


### Skateboard

### Description 
In this assignment we had to built a skateboard using part studio and Assembly. The skateboard made out of a deck, trucks, which consist of a baseplate, hanger, busing, wheel, and bearing.

### Deck Reflection 
Making a Deck was really fun and easy to make. We just had to sketch two circles in the centered conner of the rectangle, demensioned ,then extruded it. After doing that we would make a hole using the hole bar tool which I thought it was really helpful to use because you could create many hole just by using that tool bar.

### Assmebly Reflection
Doing the assmebly was really easy. The features that are in the onshape are really easy to use, and those tools make the assmebly really easy. I use the Replicate tool to add more screws in the board using that tool was really easy and fast to use. Using this tool was really helpful to use in the future. 

### Bending the Board Reflection
For the extension I bented the board to make it look more realistic. I used the spilt feature which allow us to bend the ends of the board. I use the move up face feature to make the deck bend, Lastly I use the filet tool to make the spilt part kind of flat.

### Trucks Reflection 
We built the truck baseplate using the holes in the deck. The we used the deck to create a geometry look for hunger, busing, and baseplate. We used the hole of the deck to make the holes for the truck Baseplate without having to demension it or extruded them separately. The hunger and the busing are also made of the same geometry using deck and the baseplate.

### Wheel and bearing Reflection
The wheels were created using the revolve feature because we wanted to have a round shape that's why we used the revolve tool instead of extrude. Otherwise everything was good and I enjoyed doing this assignment. 

    
### Overall Reflection
Doing this assignment was really easy and it was really fun. We used a lot of different tools which was really cause I get to know those tools better and how to use them. 
The diection's were really clear I knew what to do. But I wasn't folowing the intruction exactly that's why I use to make a lot of mistakes,and I had the screw's in the wrong direction in the deck. So I had to start over which was really annoying, but I got through it thanks to Mr. Dierolf he helped me correct my mistakes. So from my mistake I learned to follow the intruction exactly. I also learned how to make a Truck Baseplate, Truck Hanger and a Bushing. 



### Bricks

I am not fully finshed with the project but this is how far I have got. 
I am finally done with all parts today.

### Reflection
This assingment was really easy I enjoyed doing this assignment. The only trouble that I had was the color part. In the direction it shows how to add the color part I followed the direction's, but still I just couldn't find it. I asked Mr. Dierolf for help thanks to him he help me find it Otherwise I didn't had any trouble doing this assignment. 
I learned how to make a Duck using Bricks and plates.
