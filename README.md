### Reflection
Doing this was really hard. We had to design the Swing Arm by looking at the map it was really hard.I didn't know where to start or how to do it. MR. H helped me get start he explained the map to me than he designed the first part for me so I know where to start. After that I kinda knew where to start. The dimension was the hard part for me I was so confused about the dimension they were just bunch of numbers and I didn't know which dimension is for which area's. Thanks to MR. H and MR. Dierolf they helped me a lot with this project.

### Overall Reflection
Doing this assignment was really easy and it was really fun. We used a lot of different tools which was really cause I get to know those tools better and how to use them. 
The diection's were really clear I knew what to do. But I wasn't folowing the intruction exactly that's why I use to make a lot of mistakes,and I had the screw's in the wrong direction in the deck. So I had to start over which was really annoying, but I got through it thanks to Mr. Dierolf he helped me correct my mistakes. So from my mistake I learned to follow the intruction exactly. I also learned how to make a Truck Baseplate, Truck Hanger and a Bushing.

### Reflection
This assingment was really easy I enjoyed doing this assignment. The only trouble that I had was the color part. In the direction it shows how to add the color part I followed the direction's, but still I just couldn't find it. I asked Mr. Dierolf for help thanks to him he help me find it Otherwise I didn't had any trouble doing this assignment. 
I learned how to make a Duck using Bricks and plates.
